## My process

### Built with

- âœ… Semantic HTML5 markup
- âœ… CSS custom properties
- âœ… Flexbox
- âœ… Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Semantic HTML: Implementing <article>, <time>, and improving accessibility.
ðŸ”¹ Flexbox: Proper alignment of elements without unnecessary display: flex; usage.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.card {
    max-width: 375px;
    width: 100%;
    padding: 24px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:
ðŸ”¹ Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
ðŸ”¹ Improve animations and transitions for a smoother UI.
ðŸ”¹ Experiment with JavaScript to add interactivity to blog previews.
